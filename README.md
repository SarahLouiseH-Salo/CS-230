# CS-230

The client, The Gaming Room, was looking for a developer to translate their successful mobile game Draw It or Lose It onto a web format that can be cross-utilized online by any operating system. 
While determining the correct approach for the client, I believe I excelled in giving them the most straight-forward options as well as to break software development terms into something everyone in the company could understand, be it their development board or their board of directors. 

  I found that utilizing UML Diagrams was most helpful when developing the code. UML Diagrams allow you to see on one page the relationship between all aspects of a code, from class to parent/child connections. They also help when needing to add user changes from the client. In tandem with the Software Design Document, it is easier to track changes and develop them as separate but whole entities, while also giving realistic feedback to the client as to what is possible and what needs to be flexed to meet their needs.
